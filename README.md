# Retail Sales Analytics — SQL Project

**Overview**  
This project is an end-to-end SQL analytics pipeline for a retail business.  
It includes schema (DDL), sample data (CSV), analytical SQL queries, and a short business insights report.

## What’s in this repository
- `schema.sql` — SQL DDL to create the database schema (customers, products, orders, order_items).
- `sample_data/` — CSV files with sample data for each table.
- `queries.sql` — 40+ analytical SQL queries (sales trends, RFM, profitability, regions).
- `insights.md` — Business insights and suggested next steps.
- `README.md` — This file.

## How to use
1. Create a new database (MySQL / MariaDB / PostgreSQL — small syntax differences noted).
2. Run `schema.sql` to create tables.
3. Load CSV files from `sample_data/` into the tables.
4. Run queries from `queries.sql` to reproduce analyses.
5. Review `insights.md` for findings you can copy to your resume.
